    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: There is a problem of the problem with the *illusion* of redundancy in supply chain networks. Supply chain audits rely on degree, number of suppliers, number of routes, but these fail to detect shared failure modes, meaning that \"redundant\" edges or nodes may not be redundant at all.\n",

    "**Structural Metrics:** Quantify local geometry and path-based properties of the graph. These metrics are typically sensitive to degrees, distances, and flow-like behavior, but do not explicitly encode higher-order connectivity.\n",
    "- Degree change: Measures whether removal of X locally alters node connectivity.\n",
    "- Shortest-path distortion: Captures whether alternative routes preserve path efficiency.\n",
    "- Edge / node betweenness change: Measures whether traffic or flow is re-routed through different parts of the network after removal.\n",
    "- Local efficiency: Quantifies robustness of information exchange in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- Spectral stability: Measures sensitivity of the graph Laplacian spectrum to removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topological Metrics:** Quantify higher-order connectivity and redundancy of paths, capturing global structural features that persist across scales. Initial idea is that topological redundancy reflects whether X participates in persistent alternative structures rather than merely short local detours.\n",
    "- Connected components (0-dimensional homology): Detects whether removal disconnects the graph.\n",
    "- Cycle persistence (1-dimensional homology): Measures destruction of cycles that encode alternative pathways.\n",
    "- Total persistence: Captures how much “redundancy mass” is lost.\n",
    "- Loop stability across filtrations: Evaluates whether cycles persist under multiple edge-weight or distance filtrations."
